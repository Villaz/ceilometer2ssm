ceilometer2ssm
==============

This script serves as an interface between OpenStack Ceilometer and WLCG Apel accounting. The script connects to all Ceilometer instances reported by keystone, and creates SSM 
records from the retrieved data. 

CPU and network data are currently reported. Since these metrics are cumulative, only the latest record per instance is reported within the given time period. 

If the -p option is given, the created SSM records will directly send to APEL.

To get help:
ceilometer2ssm -h 

Configuration file:
/etc/ceilometer2ssm.conf
